# 👀 Kanji-Recognition Project 👀

The **Kanji-Recognition** project is an open-source machine learning project that aims to recognize handwritten Japanese kanji characters using deep learning algorithms.

## 📝 Overview

The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented in **PyTorch** to classify handwritten kanji characters. The dataset used in the project consists of over 7,000 images of handwritten kanji characters, which are preprocessed and augmented to improve the accuracy of the recognition model.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the **Kanji-Recognition** project, you will need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Jdka1/Kanji-Recognition.git
cd Kanji-Recognition
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Training the Model

To train the recognition model, you can run the `train.py` script:

```sh
python train.py
```

The script will preprocess the data, build the CNN model, and train it on the kanji image dataset. You can adjust the hyperparameters and other settings in the `config.py` file to fine-tune the model.

## 👀 Recognizing Kanji Characters

To recognize new kanji characters using the trained model, you can run the `recognize.py` script:

```sh
python recognize.py path/to/image.png
```

The script will load the trained model and use it to predict the kanji character in the specified image.
